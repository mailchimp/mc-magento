To handle rejections when sending in async mode, set up a webhook for the 'reject' event. Defaults to false for messages with no more than 10 recipients; messages with more than 10 recipients are always sent asynchronously, regardless of the value of async.
     * @param string $ip_pool the name of the dedicated ip pool that should be used to send the message. If you do not have any dedicated IPs, this parameter has no effect. If you specify a pool that does not exist, your default pool will be used instead.
     * @param string $send_at when this message should be sent as a UTC timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format. If you specify a time in the past, the message will be sent immediately. An additional fee applies for scheduled email, and this feature is only available to accounts with a positive balance.
     * @return array of structs for each recipient containing the key "email" with the email address, and details of the message status for that recipient
